This is the moment of hesitation where all creatures must decide what they intend to do in this round of combat.

At the top of every round the initiative order is rolled by a d6 plus your agility modifier. Thus the tide of battle will change from round to round and different creatures will be able to seize the initiative.

Creatures declare what they intend to do from lowest initiative to the highest (thus the faster creatures can react to the slower ones)

is recommended for the GM to have a notebook and pencil on hand to notate actions as they are declared. Symbolic shorthand follows for the most common actions.

example: subject verb object
creature doing the action, action, creature or object being acted upon. 


Actions include:
[[Combat-movement]], 
As simple as it sounds.
Draw arrow directly on the battle map (this is just a reminder so just a direction is usually sufficient)

attack 
(move toward the target and engage in [[hand-to-hand]] (shortest distance)) , 
creature declaring X creature whom it wishes to attack 

using a [[ranged]] weapon, 
firing a bow, crossbow, catapult, or firearm.
declaring creature  > target creature

interacting with an object, etc.
anything else one can imagine
notes will have to adapt to circumstances to be sufficient to remember


changing weapons happens at the end of the [[action-phase]] of the action phase of the round that the intent was declared on.
