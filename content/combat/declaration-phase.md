At the top of every round the initiative order is rolled by a d6 plus your agility modifier. Thus the tide of battle will change from round to round and different creatures will be able to seize the initiative.

Creatures declare what they intend to do from lowest initiative to the highest (thus the faster creatures can react to the slower ones)

Actions include movement, engaging other creatures in [[hand-to-hand]], using a [[ranged]] weapon, interacting with an object, etc.

changing weapons happens at the end of the round that the intent was declared on.
