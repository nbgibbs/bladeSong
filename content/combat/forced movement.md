In a variety of circumstances (i.e. [[victory levels]] in [[hand-to-hand]] or spells) a creature may be forcibly moved. If the forced creature is moved into a solid object (for example a wall) it will be stopped by the wall and receive an extra [[combat-modifiers|stagger counter]]
(-1d to physical rolls).Â 

  

(If unless otherwise noted the forcing creature follows the movement of the forced creature.)

  

Example: henry is engaged in hand to hand with a goblin and wins a victory level and decides to use it to push the goblin. The push grants a stagger counter by itself and since there was a wall just behind the goblin and the forced movement would have brought him into the wall he instead hits it and receives an additional stagger counter.
