Every round of combat is divided into 2 phases. There is a [[declaration-phase]], where creatures declare what they intend to do from lowest initiative to the highest (thus the faster creatures can react to the slower ones), and an [[action-phase]], where the actions actually take place (all actions happen at the same time unless one action would prevent another from happening in which case the one of the higher initiative creature takes priority)

# declaration phase

At the top of every round the initiative order is rolled by a d6 plus your agility modifier. Thus the tide of battle will change from round to round and different creatures will be able to seize the initiative.

Creatures declare what they intend to do from lowest initiative to the highest (thus the faster creatures can react to the slower ones)

Actions include movement, engaging other creatures in [[hand-to-hand]], using a [[ranged]] weapon, interacting with an object, etc.

changing weapons happens at the end of the round that the intent was declared on. 


# action phase

All declared actions resolve in the reverse order they were declared for game order's sake (ie. fastest to slowest). In game, however, all actions happen concurrently, unless one of them explicitly has to happen before another. 

Example 1: 2 creatures move to positions of cover. These actions happen at the same time.

Example 2: 2 creatures both try to pick up the same object. Only one can pick up the object, so the faster one succeeds while the slower one attempts but fails.
