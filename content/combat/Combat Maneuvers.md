tactics that can be used in hand to hand combat. No one is born knowing how any really work and it would take a lifetime to master them all.


defensive: +2d to combat roll but can not achieve victory levels

reckless attack: set aside X dice then make the combat roll. After victory levels are assigned but before action phase ends roll X - any dice lost after assignment of victory levels as an uncontested combat roll.

bull rush: while in hand to hand, a creature may declare they intend to bull rush. if they do they do not use victory levels normally. Instead theyÂ  force the opponent one unit plus one unit per victory level achieved (could be negative) with a minimum of 0, forced movement. If they would be forced greater than 3 units, instead they are forced 3 units and then are knocked prone. Upgraded: extra victory levels past knocking prone can be used to make an uncontested combat roll with the normal victory levels.

Flanking: allows the creature to rotate around an opponent while being in hand to hand until blocked by another hostile creature or other object. Cannot achieve victory levels

Retreating: +2d, the creature to moves directly away from an opponent it is engaged with in hand to hand until blocked by another hostile creature or other object. Cannot achieve victory levels
