Armor reduces the effective [[injury]] that a creature takes in combat. 

Armor is a lifesaver in combat. It won't stop you from getting hit (or getting tackled for that matter), but it will change a fatal injury into just a few bruises if someone tries to hurt you.Â 

Heavy or poorly fitting armor will also reduce your agility modifier.

The injury level is reduced by the effective armor level, but the [[victory levels]] remains the same. 

For example, with 1 level of armor and a [[victory levels]] of 2 you could only inflict a level 1 injury, whereas with a victory level of 1 your couldn't inflict an injury but you can still do any of the other options described in [[victory levels]].

The effective armor is calculated by taking the total armor value and subtracting the attacking creature's anti-armor value and any other modifiers with a minimum of 0. 

For example if the total armor of a creature is 3 and an attacking warhammer has an anti-armor value of 4 the effective armor value will be 0 instead of -1.
