Blade Song is not played on a grid so get those rulers handy. 1 inch = 5 feet will be compatible with most miniatures and terrain and is overall a good scale. Additionally, it may be useful to use another scale to better represent, for example, larger battlefields. I have found  that 1 cm = 5 feet is quite handy. Just keep track of which battle map is in which scale.

As explained [[Combat Sequencing|elsewhere]], all actions take place more or less simultaneously unless one will prevent the other, so, in the case of movement, it will almost always happen with all creatures simultaneously. This is sufficient for most cases. In cases where this will be insufficient 

	i.e. hostile creatures meeting and engaging in hand to hand
	
the GM will interpolate the movement to determine where each creature is when an event takes place 

	i.e. move each creature 1/6 of there total movement for that round until they meet
	
More often than not eyeballing it will be sufficient.

	i.e. 2 creatures are moving directly towards one another in such a way that their paths would overlap, the GM can assume they are moving at a steady pace and they will meet in the middle

If hostile creatures enter the reach of one another by default they stop where they are and engage in hand to hand. (for exceptions see combat [[maneuvers]])

A dash action may be taken which doubles a creatures movement speed. If they do so they may not take any other action or combat maneuver (unless otherwise stated) and if they are engaged in [[hand-to-hand]] they cannot win [[victory levels]] (if the dashing creature rolls higher it is considered a tie.
