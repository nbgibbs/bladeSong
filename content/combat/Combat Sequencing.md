Most of the time detailed sequencing only unnecessarily complicates the game and [[Game Masters]] should resolve actions in whatever order seems logical. However in some circumstances it is important to know what happens first.


In strict terms, hand to hand exchanges are resolved when the hostile creatures meet on the battlefield (i.e.. if 2 sets of creatures are moving to engage one another the set that is closer to one another will resolve first). Additionally, immediate actions (like pressing a button or picking up an object) also resolve when the creature doing the action reaches the location where it wishes to do the action. However, the vast majority of the time it doesn't matter which order the actions are resolved in. 

	i.e.. 2 sets of creatures attacking one another on opposite sides of a room 

In cases where the actions are independent and there is not an immediate consequence that could affect the actions of other creatures for that round, the actions should be resolved in whatever order make sense. highest to lowest initiative order, or simply clockwise around the table for example.


action phase: all actions are assumed to happen more or less simultaneously, but when a distinction needs to be made use the following:
"pause time" and movement
actions of highest initiative that can happen in current position (i.e. already got in place last round)
   2.1 actions of second highest 
        …
      2.x actions of lowest
"resume time and movement until another action can take place 

any [[weapons]] changes that were declared on this round



## Alternate Sequencing
### 1
---
declaration phase:
lowest initiative score declares
next lowest declares
…
highest declares

action phase: all actions are assumed to happen more or less simultaneously, but when a distinction needs to be made use the following:
first halve of movement 
actions of highest initiative
actions of second highest 
…
actions of lowest
second half of movement 
any [[weapons]] changes that were declared on this round

### 2
---
action phase: all actions are assumed to happen more or less simultaneously, but when a distinction needs to be made use the following:
saving throw (the moment where creatures can react to actions happening at the beginning of the action phase.(anything that does not require the creature to move before the action and does not take more than a moment (i.e. push a button not turn a crank)))
actions of highest initiative
actions of second highest 
…
actions of lowest
normal movement 
any [[weapons]] changes that were declared on this round
