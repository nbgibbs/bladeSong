All declared actions resolve in the reverse order they were declared for game order's sake (ie. fastest to slowest). In game, however, all actions happen concurrently, unless one of them explicitly has to happen before another. 

Example 1: 2 creatures move to positions of cover. These actions happen at the same time.

Example 2: 2 creatures both try to pick up the same object. Only one can pick up the object, so the faster one succeeds while the slower one attempts but fails.
