This is the phase where planning ends and action begins! Most of the actual dice rolls and consequences will happen here. All of the [[Combat-movement|movement]], actions, and [[hand-to-hand]] combat actually take place here. The phase ends after all of the actions for the round have taken place and and the immediate results of those actions have been determined. 

All [[declaration-phase|declared]] actions resolve in the reverse order they were declared for game order's sake (i.e.. fastest to slowest). In game, however, all actions happen concurrently, unless one of them explicitly has to happen before another. (see [[Combat Sequencing]])

	Example 1: 2 creatures move to positions of cover. These actions happen at the same time.

	Example 2: 2 creatures both try to pick up the same object. Only one can pick up the object, so the faster one succeeds while the slower one attempts but fails.

The only decision that can be made during the action phase after declaring their intentions in the declaration phase is to cancel their declared action. For example, creature A is attempting to stop creature B from fleeing through either of two doors on either side of the room. B has the initiative so A must declare its action first. A already at a huge disadvantage by not knowing which door B might be heading for, so the best bet might be to guess one of the doors and if he is wrong (or B, being faster in the moment, chooses the other door) A is not forced to continue in the wrong direction and can chose to stop and stay in the same place. Hand to hand will still take place automatically if another hostile creature is within reach, but movement or other action is lost for that turn. The idea is to not punish characters for making a bad guess unnecessarily.
