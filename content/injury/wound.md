Wound level is determined by the injury level plus the inflicting weapon's wound modifier (most likely negative) ([[weapons]]).


Level 0 wound: Very minor wound - will heal naturally over the next few hours, or faster if treated actively.

Level 1 wound: Minor wound - will naturally heal over the next few days, or faster if treated actively.

Level 2 wound: Medium wound – must be treated relatively soon, otherwise further penalties may apply (infection etc). 

Level 3 wound: Serious wound – the creature will die in time if the wound is untreated. 

Level 4 wound: Fatal wound – will die very soon if untreated.
