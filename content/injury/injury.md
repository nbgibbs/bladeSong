Injuries incur both an injury penalty on the dice available to the creature based on the level of injury and an [[wound]]. If a creature receives more than one injury the dice penalties stack but the injury effects do not.

For example: If a creature receives 2 level 1 injuries they will have the equivalent dice penalty to a level 2 injury, but they will only suffer the effects of the level 1 injuries.

The dice penalty will be the level of injury unless otherwise stated. (ie. a level 1 injury will have a dice penalty of 1, a level 2 will have 2 ect)

If a creature revives a dice penalty of 3 plus there strength score they are incapacitated, but death does not occur solely from the dice penalty. Death will be described in the [[wound]]. (ie. bleeding out)
