tactics that can be used in hand to hand combat. No one is born knowing how any really work and it would take a lifetime to master them    all.


defensive: +2d to combat roll but can not achieve victory levels

reckless attack: set aside X dice then make the combat roll. After victory levels are assigned but before action phase ends roll X - any dice lost    after assignment of victory levels as an uncontested combat roll.

bull rush: while in hand to hand, force the opponent one unit plus one unit per victory level achieved (could be negative) with a minimum of 0. with  3 or greater victory levels the opponent is forced 3 units and is then knocked prone. additional victory levels after 3 may be used to make a weapon  attack. 

Flanking: allows the creature to rotate around an opponent while being in hand to hand until blocked by another hostile creature or other object.     Cannot achieve victory levels

Retreating: +2d, the creature to moves directly away from an opponent it is engaged with in hand to hand until blocked by another hostile creature or other object. Cannot achieve victory levels
