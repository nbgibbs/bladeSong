Hand-to-hand engagements are contested rolls where each creature adds their strength and agility modifiers as well as any weapon or other modifiers. 

These rolls do not represent a singular attack, but rather an "exchange" lasting a few seconds.

Hostile creatures are automatically engaged in hand to hand when they are within reach of each other. If a creature chooses not to engage in hand to hand (ie. to do some other action), the other creature can make an uncontested combat role against that creature.

The rolls are made and the results are tallied during the [[action-phase]], and the creature with more wins on the dice wins the exchange for that round with a [[victory-level]] equal to the difference in the total number of wins from each creature.

If there is a tie in wins for a round, there is no winner in the exchange for that round.

Creatures can also preform various combat [[maneuvers]] as their intentions and abilities dictate.
