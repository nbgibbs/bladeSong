The majority of rolls in the system consist of rolling a dice pool of a number of dice each with a 50% chance of being a win (a 6 sided dice counting 4, 5 and 6 as a win). The dice pool for a given challenge is:

3 + any applicable [[attributes]] scores (could be negative) + any applicable skills + any tools or other modifiers.

More skills and tools = more dice = better chance of getting enough wins against a given challenge.
