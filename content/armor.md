Armor reduces the effective [[injury]] that a creature takes in combat. 

The injury level is reduced by the effective armor level, but the [[victory-level]] remains the same. For example, with 1 level of armor and a [[victory-level]] of 2 you could only inflict a level 1 injury, whereas with a victory level of 1 your couldn't inflict an injury but you can still do any of the other options described in [[victory-level]].

The effective armor is calculated by taking the total armor value and subtracting the attacking creature's anti-armor value and any other modifiers with a minimum of 0. 

For example if the total armor of a creature is 3 and an attacking warhammer has an anti-armor value of 4 the effective armor value will be 0 instead of -1.
