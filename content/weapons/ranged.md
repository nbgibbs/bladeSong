	Ranged attacks are made by first rolling to hit (base of 3 plus agility plus weapon proficiency) then rolling for damage (weapon specific).

The difficulty to hit will be based on range and size of target.

Bows will have a strength requirement and if you don't meet the requirement a to hit penalty will be imposed.
