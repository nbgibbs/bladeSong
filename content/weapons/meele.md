[[meele]] weapons in this system will grant the wielder additional dice to use in [[hand-to-hand]] combat. Additionally, individual weapons will have certain anti-armor properties, and certain wound properties. 

For example a war hammer will be more effective than a sword against armor (assuming the same victory level) and a knife will deal more serious and lasting wounds than a simple stick of similar proportions. 

A generic formula may be followed to determine the properties of a weapon (though there may be exceptions). The bonus dice will be the weapon size plus all other weapon bonus dice values based on the attributes in the following table (some values may be negative).


# size

Larger weapons are inherently more powerful than small ones.

Tiny weapons: something equivalent to a typical pocket knife. 

	no additional bonus to dice in hand-to-hand. Though it may have different injury effects.

Small weapons: dagger sized. Bigger than your average pocket knife, but not sword sized.

	an additional 1 dice to the hand-to-hand role

Medium weapons: Larger than a small weapon, but can still easily be wielded in one hand 

	add 2 additional dice and effectively reduce the target's armor by 1

Large weapons: 2 handed weapons like longswords, but not polearms.

	add 3 additional dice and effectively reduce the target's armor by 2

Reach weapons: Man height weapons and larger

	add 4 additional dice and effectively reduce the target's armor by 3
