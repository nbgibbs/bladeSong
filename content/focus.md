Focus and adrenaline are used to extend your normal abilities for a limited time. If you really focus you can perform quite a bit better but you will mentally tire.

To use focus you will replace a number of dice in a roll with focus points. Focus points, when used, will always count as a win. 

For example: a creature is attempting to climb a building with a CR of 4. With its agility modifier and proficiency it can roll 6 dice. To improve its odds it can chose to use an adrenaline point to improve its odds (from 34% to 50%). In this case it would get one automatic win from the adrenaline point and then roll the remaining 5 dice.

Example 2: a creature is attempting to leap across a bottomless pit with a CR of 2. Any failure would result in almost certain death so, even though it would have a pretty good chance to succeed with its available 5 dice for this challenge, the creature chooses to use 2 adrenaline points to guarantee success.
