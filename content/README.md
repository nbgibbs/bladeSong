# Welcome to the Blade Song rulebook! 

Blade Song is a table top role playing system that I am developing (a work in progress). It is written using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to make a wiki style database for easy reference. 

You have a couple of options when it comes to reading this rulebook. You can simply read it in your web browser, or (to take full advantage of Obsidian's features) you can install Obsidian and either clone this git repository or just download it as a zip file. 

If you are familiar with Obsidian and already use it setup is as easy as cloning this repository and opening it as a Obsidian vault. If not setup instructions will follow.

If you do decide to read this in your browser, some cursory knowledge of Obsidian will help you along.

## What is Obsidian?

Obsidian, if you don't know, is a powerful note-taking and knowledge management application that uses a local folder of plain text Markdown files as its database, known as a "vault." 

The main feature of Obsidian and why I used it to make this rulebook is its ability to create links by surrounding text with brackets. For example, [[introduction]] links to the introduction page (introduction.md).

If you plan to read in the browser you are good to go! However if you really want to take advantage of the links and backlinks you will need the Obsidian application.

## Getting Started

To set up an Obsidian vault on your computer, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Download and Install Obsidian

1. Visit the [Obsidian website](https://obsidian.md/) and download the appropriate version for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). It is also available on iOS and Android. 
2. Follow the installation instructions provided by Obsidian to install the application on your computer.

### Step 2: Clone or Download this Repository

 Clone this repository to your local machine using Git. Alternatively, you can download the repository as a ZIP file and extract it to a location of your choice.

### Step 3: Open Obsidian and Create a New Vault

1. Launch the Obsidian application on your computer.
2. Click on "Open another vault" 
3. Click on "Open folder as vault"
4. Browse to the location where you cloned or extracted this repository and select it.
5. Click "Open" to open the rulebook within Obsidian giving you access to all of the links and backlinks.

### Step 4: Done!

Congratulations! You've successfully set up the rulebook and an Obsidian vault. You can now follow links and backlinks to other pages.
