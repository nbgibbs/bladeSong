With a traditional d20 system, the higher your modifier (the more skilled you are) the more likely you are to succeed at any given challenge rating. This is as should be expected. Where this breaks down is when you make the (intuitive) assumption that the higher you roll the better you preform linearly in whatever task required the roll. The problem is exacerbated with the popular homebrew rule where a natural 20 is always a success and a natural 1 is always a failure. For an illustrative example: suppose we have 2 characters, one is not very good at picking locks (+0 modifier) and the other is superhumanly good (let's say something like a +10 modifier). They are both just as likely as the other to preform in such a way that they could open even a nigh unpickable lock and just as likely as the other to preform so poorly that they couldn't open even the simplest of locks (DC 1).

This problem can be alleviated somewhat by forgoing the critical success and failure rule, and it almost vanishes if we treat every roll as only a pass or fail, but this does not feel intuitive.
