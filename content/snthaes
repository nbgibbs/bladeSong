Action phase: This is the phase where planning ends and action begins! Most of the actual dice rolls and consequences will happen here. All of the movement, actions, and combat actually take place here. The phase ends after all of the actions have taken place and and the immediate results of those actions have been determined. 

The only decision that can be made during the action phase after declaring their intentions in the declaration phase is to cancel their declared action. For example, creature A is attempting to stop creature B from fleeing through either of two doors on either side of the room. B has the initiative so A must declare its action first. A already at a huge disadvantage by not knowing which door B might be heading for, so the best bet might be to guess one of the doors and if he is wrong (or B, being faster in the moment, choses the other door) A is not forced to continue in the wrong direction and can chose to stop and stay in the same place. Hand to hand will still take place automatically if another hostile creature is within reach, but movement or other action is lost for that turn. The idea is to not punish characters for making a bad guess unnecessarily. 


declaration phase:
lowest initiative score declares
next lowest declares
...
highest declares

action phase: all actions are assumed to happen more or less simultaneously, but when a distinction needs to be made use the following:
first have of movement 
actions of highest initiative
actions of second highest 
...
actions of lowest
second half of movement 
any weapon changes that were declared on this round

action phase: all actions are assumed to happen more or less simultaneously, but when a distinction needs to be made use the following:
saving throw (the moment where creatures can react to actions happening at the beginning of the action phase.(anything that does not require the creature to move before the action and does not take more than a moment (ie push a button not turn a crank)))
actions of highest initiative
actions of second highest 
...
actions of lowest
normal movement 
any weapon changes that were declared on this round

In strict terms, hand to hand exchanges are resolved when the hostile creatures meet on the battlefield (ie. if 2 sets of creatures are moving to engage one another the set that is closer to one another will resolve first). Additionally, immediate actions (like pressing a button or picking up an object) also resolve when the creature doing the action reaches the location where it wishes to do the action. However, the vast majority of the time it doesn't matter which order the actions are resolved in (ie. 2 sets of creatures attacking one another on opposite sides of a room). In cases where the actions are independent and there is not an immediate consequence for anyone else, the actions should be resolved in whatever order make sense. highest to lowest initiative for example.


action phase: all actions are assumed to happen more or less simultaneously, but when a distinction needs to be made use the following:
"pause time" and movement
actions of highest initiative that can happen in current position (ie already got in place last round)
   2.1 actions of second highest 
        ...
      2.x actions of lowest
"resume time and movment until another action can take place
